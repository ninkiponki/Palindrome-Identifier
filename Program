#   Purpose: To determine if a list of up to 20 words are a palindrome or not
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Global Variables
amt = 0  # Stores the amount of words user wants to input
texts = []  # Holds all words from user
text = []  # Holds all words from user reversed


# Main Function
def palindrome():
    validInput = False  # Begins while loop

    # Loops through until valid response
    while not validInput:

        # Try to get the correct input of an int
        try:
            # Iterations the amount of palindromes
            amt = int(input("How many words would you like to test are palindromes? "
                            "\nPlease input a number no larger than 20"
                            "\nEnter your number:   "))

            # If iterations is less or equal to 20 and isn't a negative number then input is valid
            # Else let user know the error they made and re ask question
            if 20 >= amt > 0:
                validInput = True
            else:
                print("Invalid Input! \nPlease enter a number from 1 - 20")
                spacer = input()  # Spaces out the print statements to give the user a chance to read
                print("\n" * 2)

        # If value to iteration isn't an int let user know their error and re ask the question
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid Input! \nPlease input a whole number")
            spacer = input()
            print("\n" * 2)

    # Asks for a word the amount of times the user input into iterations
    for x in range(amt):

        correct = False  # Begins the loop

        # loops through until there is a valid response
        while not correct:

            # Gets the word user would like to test
            word = input("Enter a word:   ")

            # If the word exceeds the character limit of 70 then re ask the question
            if len(word) > 70:
                print("Invalid input! \nExceeded 70 character limit")
                spacer = input()

            # If word is within the parameters then:
            else:
                texts.append(word)  # Stores the word
                text.append(word[::-1])  # Reverse the word and add it to the text list
                correct = True  # Exit loop

    # Goes through every word
    for x in range(amt):

        # If the word is the same backwards then it is a palindrome
        if texts[x].lower() == text[x].lower():
            print("Yes '" + texts[x] + "'")

        # Else the word is not a palindrome
        else:
            print("No '" + texts[x] + "'")


# Calls the function palindrome
palindrome()
