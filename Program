#   Purpose: To determine if a list of up to 20 words are a palindrome or not
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Global Variables
amt = 0  # Stores the amount of words user wants to input
words = [] # Stores the original words from the user
fWords = []  # Holds all words from user
bWords = []  # Holds all words from user reversed


# Main Function
def palindrome():
    validInput = False  # Begins while loop

    # Loops through until valid response
    while not validInput:

        # Try to get the correct input of an int
        try:
            # Iterations the amount of palindromes

                            "\nPlease input a number no larger than 20"
                            "\nEnter your number:   "))

            # If iterations is less or equal to 20 and isn't a negative number then input is valid
            # Else let user know the error they made and re ask question
            if 20 >= amt > 0:
                validInput = True
            else:
                print("Invalid Input! \nPlease enter a number from 1 - 20")
                spacer = input()  # Spaces out the print statements to give the user a chance to read
                print("\n" * 2)

        # If value to iteration isn't an int let user know their error and re ask the question

    # Asks for a word the amount of times the user input into iterations

        # loops through until there is a valid response
        while not correct:

                spacer = input()

            # If word is within the parameters then:
            else:
                words.append(word)  # Stores the word in the word list

                # convert word to all lowercase and removes spaces to only then store it in the list
                fWords.append(word.lower().replace(" ", ""))

                # reverses word then converts word to all lowercase and removes spaces to only then store it in the list
                bWords.append(word[::-1].lower().replace(" ", ""))

                correct = True  # Exit loop

    # Goes through every word
    for x in range(amt):

        # If the word is the same backwards then it is a palindrome
        if fWords[x] == bWords[x]:

        # Else the word is not a palindrome
        else:

# Calls the function palindrome
